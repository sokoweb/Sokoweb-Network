# SokoWeb
## Decentralized Commerce Network

A distributed commerce network for peer-to-peer product/service listings, search, and discovery.

### üìã Overview

SokoWeb enables users to create and discover product listings in a decentralized network, with support for location-based search, image uploads, and credit management.

### üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
pip install sokoweb
sokoweb-up
# or for detached mode
sokoweb-up -d
```

You'll be prompted for:
- `NODE_PORT` (default: 8000)
- `NODE_TCP_PORT` (default: 8500)
- `ADVERTISE_IP` (default: localhost)

> **Note:** Use a public IP/domain to join the network. Localhost works for exploration but won't connect to other nodes. Tunneling services like Ngrok typically won't work as the network requires UDP and TCP access.

### üìã Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Docker 27.3.1+
- docker compose 2.29.7+
